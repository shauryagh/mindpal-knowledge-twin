# 🧩 **Project: MindPal – Your AI Memory & Knowledge Twin**

### 🔹 Problem

* People forget information they learn (lectures, notes, research).
* Notes apps are static → you can’t interact or ask questions about your own knowledge.

---

### 🔹 Solution

**MindPal** is an **AI-powered personal knowledge assistant** that:

1. Lets users upload notes, PDFs, and text snippets.
2. Creates a **knowledge graph** connecting concepts automatically.
3. Allows users to **chat with their notes**:

   * Example: “Explain the key points of last week’s lecture.”
4. Uses **smart summarization + retrieval** to surface information in plain language.
5. Optional gamification: reminds you of forgotten notes (spaced repetition).
